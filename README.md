## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- And a whole lot of Googling

### What I learned

I learned a lot about Flexbox, mostly how to control Flex items using justify-content and align-items.

Things that were new to me:

- You can use CSS to add a shadow to div boxes (makes flat divs pop out).
- When using Google Fonts, you can use multiple font weights of the same font. Just click on the weights or styles that you want to incorporate in your project.
